# Py_Library_NFC
a library to interact with nfc cards and readers from python using pyscard

## Roadmap

## Getting Started

for windows:
```
pip install pyscard
```

for ubuntu:
```
sudo apt install swig
sudo apt install -y python3-pyscard
sudo apt install pcscd # needed to scan for readers on ubuntu

# if you get errors (ARC nfc reader has this with ubuntu)
sudo vim /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-libnfc.conf
# Add this line: blacklist pn533_usb
# Reboot
```

## Development

### NFC
#### connecting with Pyscard
Can only be used with version 3.6.8 of python (as of moment of writing). Thus we have to switch for this application to this python version in order to use this NFC library.
Downloaded pyscard executable for windows from https://sourceforge.net/projects/pyscard/
