# Py_Library_NFC
A library can be used to interact with nfc cards and readers

Standalone code takes care of converting the data (strings, integers, bytes, ndef messages) to a bytearray that can be written to the card and reader.
Pyscard is used to actually transfer / read the bytes to / from the card.
Ndeflib is used to format according to the NDEF message standards.


## Roadmap

## Getting Started
### pyscard
for windows:
```
pip install pyscard
```

for ubuntu:
```
sudo apt install swig
sudo apt install -y python3-pyscard
sudo apt install pcscd # needed to scan for readers on ubuntu

# if you get errors (ARC nfc reader has this with ubuntu)
sudo vim /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-libnfc.conf
# Add this line: blacklist pn533_usb
# Reboot
```

### ndef library
```
pip install ndeflib
```

## Development

### NFC
#### connecting with Pyscard
Should be usable with python version 3.3 or higher, but Tested on version 3.6.8.

### other info sources used for development of this library
#### pyscard
pyscard tutorial: https://pyscard.sourceforge.io/user-guide.html

#### Using ARC connect library on top of pyscard
https://github.com/StevenTso/ACS-ACR122U-NFC-Reader

#### libusb
usb library for linux

download libusb
https://libusb.info/

#### encoding with ndeflib
encoding and decoding messages from NDEF format (nfc data exchange format)

https://pypi.org/project/ndeflib/
https://ndeflib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ndef.html

## Running the tests
After cloning the repo and downloading the dependencies, run the following script:
```
python3 test_class_nfc.py
```

To test completely it expects a valid ARC nfc reader and a presented nfc card
